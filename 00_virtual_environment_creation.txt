Always activate a virtual environment for your projects.



How to create and activate your virtual environment?

1. Open terminal using "Ctrl + ~"

2. Execute "pwd" to check your present working directory where the virtual environment will be installed.

3. Execute "python3 -m venv .venv" to create a virtual environment folder named .venv.

4. Execute "source .venv/bin/activate" to activate your virtual environment.

5. Now you can import libraries on this virtual environment.

   Eg. To use Jupyter Notebook you require ipykernel library which you can install using "pip install ipykernel"

Always make sure you are downloading any library in your virtual environment.
